Read the analysis carefully. Your goal is to **enrich** the ontology by adding
meaningful object properties that create cross-cutting relationships between
classes that are currently only connected through the subClassOf hierarchy.

Guidelines:
- Focus on classes listed as "taxonomy-only" or in disconnected components.
- Add object properties with proper rdfs:domain, rdfs:range, rdfs:label, and
  rdfs:comment.
- Do NOT remove existing content — only add new relationships.
- Each new property should capture a genuine semantic relationship from the
  source material (e.g., "isRegulatedBy", "participatesIn", "dependsOn").
- Aim to bring property coverage above 50% and reduce taxonomy-only classes.

After making your additions, confirm that you are done."""
