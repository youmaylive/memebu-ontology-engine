    <rdfs:label>excites</rdfs:label>
    <rdfs:comment>This property represents excitatory connections between neurons. Excitation drives spiking and spreads activity through networks. Excitatory connections are modified by learning and determine information flow.

    <rdfs:comment>Implicit learning acquires knowledge without conscious awareness or intention to learn. Examples include motor skills, artificial grammar, and statistical regularities. Implicit learning involves basal ganglia and cerebellum contrasting with explicit hippocampal learning. Implicit knowledge is hard to verbalize but guides behavior.

    <rdfs:comment>Calcium signaling involves changes in intracellular calcium concentration that trigger various cellular processes. In neurons, calcium enters through voltage-gated channels, NMDA receptors, and is released from internal stores.

    <rdfs:label>releases</rdfs:label>
    <rdfs:comment>This property relates a neuron to the neurotransmitter it releases at its synaptic terminals. Most neurons release one primary fast neurotransmitter (glutamate or GABA) but may also release neuromodulators or neuropeptides. The transmitter determines whether synapses are excitatory or inhibitory and what receptors mediate the response.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>Generalization transfers learning to new stimuli or contexts similar to trained conditions. Generalization gradients reflect similarity between test and trained stimuli. Appropriate generalization enables using experience in novel situations while excessive generalization causes overgeneralization. Similarity representations in neural codes determine generalization.

    <rdfs:label>Ionotropic Receptor</rdfs:label>
    <rdfs:comment>Ionotropic receptors are ligand-gated ion channels that rapidly change membrane potential upon neurotransmitter binding. They mediate fast synaptic transmission on millisecond timescales. Examples include AMPA, NMDA, GABA-A, and nicotinic receptors. Ion selectivity determines whether responses are excitatory or inhibitory. Receptor kinetics shape temporal dynamics of synaptic currents.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>Attention selectively enhances processing of relevant stimuli while filtering distractors. Mechanisms include increased gain, reduced noise correlations, synchronized oscillations, and competitive interactions. Top-down attention from prefrontal and parietal cortex modulates sensory processing via feedback connections. Bottom-up attention is driven by stimulus salience. Attention enhances encoding, speeds processing, and improves discrimination.</rdfs:comment>
    <rdfs:comment>Attention mechanisms in machine learning selectively weight inputs based on relevance. They enable flexible routing of information and long-range dependencies. Attention is differentiable and learned end-to-end. While inspired by biological attention, implementations differ - biological attention involves top-down modulation while ML attention is computed from inputs.

    <rdfs:comment>Thalamic reticular nucleus neurons are GABAergic interneurons providing feedforward and feedback inhibition to thalamocortical neurons. They have extensive dendritic arbors, show burst firing, and are interconnected by gap junctions. TRN implements sensory gating, generates spindle oscillations, and may focus attention by inhibiting neurons representing unattended stimuli. TRN forms a shell around dorsal thalamus.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:label>Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity</rdfs:label>
    <rdfs:comment>Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is a form of synaptic plasticity where the change in synaptic strength depends on the precise timing between presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes. If the presynaptic spike precedes the postsynaptic spike within a critical window (typically 20ms), the synapse is strengthened; if the order is reversed, it is weakened. This implements a causality-based learning rule.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>A Markov process is a stochastic process where future states depend only on the current state, not on past history.

    <rdfs:comment>Inferior olive provides climbing fiber input to cerebellar Purkinje cells serving as a teaching signal in motor learning. Each Purkinje cell receives input from one climbing fiber producing complex spikes. Climbing fiber activity signals errors between intended and actual movement and drives plasticity of parallel fiber synapses.
