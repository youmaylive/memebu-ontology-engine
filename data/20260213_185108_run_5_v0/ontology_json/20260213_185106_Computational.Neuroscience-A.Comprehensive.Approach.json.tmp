      "rdfs:comment": "Neuronal oscillations are rhythmic or repetitive patterns of neural activity in the central nervous system. They occur at various frequencies from slow delta waves to fast gamma oscillations. Oscillations coordinate neural activity across brain regions, provide temporal windows for plasticity, and support information processing. Different frequency bands are associated with distinct cognitive and behavioral states.",

      "rdfs:comment": "Delta oscillations (0.5-4 Hz) are slow brain waves prominent during deep sleep. They reflect synchronized transitions between up states with high firing and down states with neuronal silence. Delta waves are generated by thalamocortical loops and may support memory consolidation. Increased delta during waking indicates drowsiness or pathology.",

      "rdfs:comment": "Sleep spindles are bursts of 11-16 Hz oscillations during stage 2 sleep generated by thalamic reticular nucleus. They reflect rhythmic inhibition of thalamocortical neurons. Spindles may gate sensory processing during sleep and support memory consolidation. Spindle density correlates with cognitive abilities and learning.",

Fast ripples can indicate pathological tissue in epilepsy. HFOs reflect coordinated synaptic activity and fast inhibitory interneuron dynamics.",

CFC coordinates activity across timescales and spatial scales. Theta-gamma coupling in hippocampus organizes memory encoding. CFC may implement multiplexing and routing of information.",
